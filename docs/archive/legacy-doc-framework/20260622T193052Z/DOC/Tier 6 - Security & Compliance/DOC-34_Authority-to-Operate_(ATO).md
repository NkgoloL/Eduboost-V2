# Authority to Operate (ATO)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document ID | EDB-ATO-034 |
| Product | EduBoost SA / EduBoost V2 |
| Version | 2.0 aligned baseline |
| Generated | 2026-06-22 |
| Status | Aligned baseline draft |
| Classification | Internal - controlled |
| Replacement note | Replaces stale DBE policy-advisory content previously found in `docs/DOC` |

## Authoritative project baseline

This document is aligned to the EduBoost V2 repository supplied on 2026-06-22. It replaces the prior `docs/DOC` material that described a different DBE policy-advisory system.

| Area | Current baseline |
|---|---|
| Product | EduBoost SA, a CAPS-aligned adaptive learning platform for South African primary learners |
| Active backend | `app/api_v2.py` FastAPI modular monolith, mounted under `/api/v2` and `/v2` |
| Frontend | `app/frontend`, package `eduboost-sa-frontend`, Next.js `16.2.7`, React `18.3.1`, TypeScript `5.4.5` |
| Package manager | pnpm `9.14.4` for frontend |
| Python runtime | Python `3.12.3` |
| Persistence | PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy/Alembic; 44 Alembic revision files in the supplied archive |
| Queue/cache | Redis and ARQ worker path (`app.modules.jobs.WorkerSettings`); V2 should not introduce Celery/RabbitMQ for new work |
| Launch curriculum scope | `grade4_mathematics_en`: CAPS refs 4.M.1.1, 4.M.1.2, 4.M.1.3 |
| Content targets | 40 approved diagnostic items, 8 approved lessons, 1 assessment blueprint, and 1 study-plan template per launch CAPS ref |
| API surface | 205 route handlers discovered by static router scan, plus health/readiness/metrics root routes |
| Tests | 767 backend test files and approximately 44 frontend test/spec files in the archive |
| Workflows | 44 GitHub Actions workflow files |

### Claim discipline

Unless fresh CI, staging, backup/restore, security, POPIA and release evidence is attached, these documents describe the current implementation and target operating model. They must not be used to claim that the system is production-ready.

## ATO status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| System | EduBoost SA / EduBoost V2 |
| Environment | Not specified by this document |
| Current decision | Not authorised for production by this document |
| Decision owner | Pending named approver |
| Evidence bundle | Pending fresh CI/staging/security/POPIA/DR evidence |

## ATO decision criteria

| Criterion | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| Runtime health | App import, health/readiness and staging smoke. |
| API correctness | OpenAPI/route inventory drift checks. |
| Database readiness | Migration graph, schema integrity and backup/restore. |
| Security | Secret validation, dependency scan, auth/object-level tests. |
| POPIA | Consent and data-rights tests plus legal sign-off. |
| Content | Launch scope coverage, review/promotion evidence and rollback plan. |
| Frontend | pnpm lint, type-check, Vitest and E2E journey. |
| Operations | Monitoring, incident response, rollback and support plan. |

## ATO decision options

- **Deny**: release blocked.
- **Conditional**: limited beta/staging with explicit compensating controls.
- **Authorise**: only after all required evidence is current and accepted.

## Source-of-truth references

## Standard verification gate

Run the closest applicable subset before accepting a document-controlled change:

```bash
python3 -m compileall -q app scripts
python3 -m ruff check app tests scripts --select E9,F63,F7,F82,F821
python3 scripts/verify_migration_graph.py
python3 scripts/validate_schema_integrity.py
python3 scripts/check_runtime_entrypoints.py
python3 scripts/generate_openapi.py --check
python3 scripts/generate_route_inventory.py --check
make test-fast
cd app/frontend && pnpm run env-check && pnpm run lint && pnpm run type-check && pnpm run test
```

For release claims add integration tests, Docker Compose validation, staging smoke tests, Playwright E2E, backup/restore proof, rollback proof, and security/POPIA evidence.
