# Risk Register (RR)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document ID | EDB-RR-036 |
| Product | EduBoost SA / EduBoost V2 |
| Version | 2.0 aligned baseline |
| Generated | 2026-06-22 |
| Status | Aligned baseline draft |
| Classification | Internal - controlled |
| Replacement note | Replaces stale DBE policy-advisory content previously found in `docs/DOC` |

## Authoritative project baseline

This document is aligned to the EduBoost V2 repository supplied on 2026-06-22. It replaces the prior `docs/DOC` material that described a different DBE policy-advisory system.

| Area | Current baseline |
|---|---|
| Product | EduBoost SA, a CAPS-aligned adaptive learning platform for South African primary learners |
| Active backend | `app/api_v2.py` FastAPI modular monolith, mounted under `/api/v2` and `/v2` |
| Frontend | `app/frontend`, package `eduboost-sa-frontend`, Next.js `16.2.7`, React `18.3.1`, TypeScript `5.4.5` |
| Package manager | pnpm `9.14.4` for frontend |
| Python runtime | Python `3.12.3` |
| Persistence | PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy/Alembic; 44 Alembic revision files in the supplied archive |
| Queue/cache | Redis and ARQ worker path (`app.modules.jobs.WorkerSettings`); V2 should not introduce Celery/RabbitMQ for new work |
| Launch curriculum scope | `grade4_mathematics_en`: CAPS refs 4.M.1.1, 4.M.1.2, 4.M.1.3 |
| Content targets | 40 approved diagnostic items, 8 approved lessons, 1 assessment blueprint, and 1 study-plan template per launch CAPS ref |
| API surface | 205 route handlers discovered by static router scan, plus health/readiness/metrics root routes |
| Tests | 767 backend test files and approximately 44 frontend test/spec files in the archive |
| Workflows | 44 GitHub Actions workflow files |

### Claim discipline

Unless fresh CI, staging, backup/restore, security, POPIA and release evidence is attached, these documents describe the current implementation and target operating model. They must not be used to claim that the system is production-ready.

## Active risk register

| ID | Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-001 | Stale docs contradict current runtime and mislead delivery. | High | Replace `docs/DOC`, add stale-term scan and doc review gate. | Engineering/docs |
| R-002 | Auth context shape drift breaks protected POPIA/data-rights flows. | High | Normalise actor helper and add router-level regression tests. | Backend |
| R-003 | Frontend API paths drift from backend OpenAPI. | High | Add OpenAPI-driven frontend route contract tests. | Frontend/backend |
| R-004 | Content coverage is overclaimed beyond launch slice. | High | Scope-bound claims to Grade 4 Mathematics refs and require coverage evidence. | Product/content |
| R-005 | Generated content reaches learners without adequate review. | Critical | Enforce provenance, validation, answer-key verification and review gates. | Content governance |
| R-006 | Child/guardian data is exposed through logs, exports or authorisation flaws. | Critical | POPIA tests, log redaction, object-level auth and PIA/ATO review. | Security/compliance |
| R-007 | CI or local setup diverges from pnpm/Python/Alembic baseline. | Medium | Keep scripts/tooling aligned and verified in CI. | Platform |
| R-008 | Backup/restore/rollback is unproven. | High | Run target-environment DR drill before launch. | Operations |
| R-009 | AI provider outage or unsafe response degrades learner experience. | Medium | Provider health, safety filters, timeouts, budgets and fallback behaviour. | AI/platform |
| R-010 | Legacy Celery/RabbitMQ references re-enter architecture. | Medium | Enforce V2 ARQ/Redis decision and review dependency changes. | Architecture |

## Standard verification gate

Run the closest applicable subset before accepting a document-controlled change:

```bash
python3 -m compileall -q app scripts
python3 -m ruff check app tests scripts --select E9,F63,F7,F82,F821
python3 scripts/verify_migration_graph.py
python3 scripts/validate_schema_integrity.py
python3 scripts/check_runtime_entrypoints.py
python3 scripts/generate_openapi.py --check
python3 scripts/generate_route_inventory.py --check
make test-fast
cd app/frontend && pnpm run env-check && pnpm run lint && pnpm run type-check && pnpm run test
```

For release claims add integration tests, Docker Compose validation, staging smoke tests, Playwright E2E, backup/restore proof, rollback proof, and security/POPIA evidence.
