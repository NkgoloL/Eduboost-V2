# Auth Service Cleanup Status

Generated at: `2026-06-27T02:18:40Z`
Commit: `88840fc52a05c694c6d313e57bc8cba4bcda4c63`

**Status:** `auth-service-cleanup-passing`

## Service methods present

- `create_dev_session`
- `login`
- `logout`
- `refresh`
- `register`
- `revoke_all_tokens`

## Route delegation

- Present: `logout, revoke_all_tokens`
- Missing: `-`

## Monkey patches

- None

## Blockers

- None

## No false-closure rules

- No module-level `AuthApplicationService.<method> = ...` assignments may remain.
- Service method presence does not prove HTTP route semantics.
- Missing logout/revoke route delegation remains visible until repaired.
- This cleanup does not approve beta release.
