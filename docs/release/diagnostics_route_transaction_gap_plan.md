# Diagnostics Route Transaction Gap Plan

Generated at: `2026-06-12T17:40:54Z`
Commit: `a70b57616bb29572fcb57961b91a3f68f0c66329`

- Source report: `docs/release/diagnostics_route_transaction_slice_report.json`
- Source local status: `route-diagnostics-delegation-not-proven`
- Source live DB status: `external-blocked`
- Status: `blocked`
- Action count: `1`

## Gap actions

| Route function | Line | Current status | Reason | Closeable by current report |
|---|---:|---|---|---:|
| `submit_diagnostic` | 103 | `not-proven` | no diagnostics service delegate call found | False |

## No false-closure rules

- Do not mark ROUTE-TX-DIAG-001 proven while local_status is route-diagnostics-delegation-not-proven.
- Do not close live DB proof from local source reports.
- Do not use generated gap plans as implementation evidence.

## Interpretation

This plan is a blocker queue. It is not proof that diagnostics route transaction wiring is complete.
