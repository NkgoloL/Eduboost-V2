## Implementation procedure

1. Read the LEV-WS02 workstream specification and confirm prerequisites for task 02.14.
2. Open or update the task evidence record before changing code, data, instruments or governance documents.
3. Implement the required work exactly as scoped: Set approval, expiry, drift-review and retirement rules for concepts and items.
4. Confirm lawful authority, consent/assent, independence and conflict-of-interest controls before participant or reviewer activity.
5. Record attendance, decisions, dissent, requested corrections and signed approval or rejection.
6. Attach or link the required evidence: Lifecycle policy implemented in content governance.
7. Mark complete only after the acceptance criterion is independently verifiable.
