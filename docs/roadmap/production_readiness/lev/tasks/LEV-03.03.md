# LEV-03.03 — Implementation Task Card

**Workstream:** LEV-WS03 — Make learner evidence and state changes fully traceable  
**Phase:** LEV-1  
**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** `not_started`  
**Implementation type:** `engineering`  
**Estimated effort:** M/L  
**Human dependency:** No  
**Cannot be completed by code alone:** No

## Required outcome

Implement append-only event persistence with stable event identifiers, ordering guarantees and tamper-evident integrity controls.

## Definition-of-done link

Learner evidence and state changes are fully traceable.

## Dependencies

- `LEV-03.02`

## Existing repository files to inspect or modify

- `app/models/runtime_kg.py`
- `app/services/runtime_kg/repository.py`
- `app/services/runtime_kg/service.py`
- `app/services/runtime_kg/integration.py`
- `app/repositories/audit_repository.py`
- `app/services/audit_service.py`
- `app/core/audit.py`
- `alembic/versions`

## Planned or new files

- `app/models/educational_validation.py`
- `app/repositories/educational_validation_repository.py`
- `app/services/educational_validation/traceability.py`
- `alembic/versions/<new>_educational_validation_traceability.py`
- `docs/research/longitudinal_validation/evidence/03.03_persistence_tests_and_integrity_verification_pass.md`

## Implementation procedure

1. Read the LEV-WS03 workstream specification and confirm prerequisites for task 03.03.
2. Open or update the task evidence record before changing code, data, instruments or governance documents.
3. Implement the required work exactly as scoped: Implement append-only event persistence with stable event identifiers, ordering guarantees and tamper-evident integrity controls.
4. Add or update unit, integration and contract tests for the changed behaviour.
5. Run focused checks, then the LEV register verifier and applicable repository quality gates.
6. Attach or link the required evidence: Persistence tests and integrity verification pass.
7. Mark complete only after the acceptance criterion is independently verifiable.

## Verification commands

```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/verify_lev_task_register.py --repo-root . --json
```
```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/lev_task_cli.py show <TASK_ID>
```
```bash
pytest -q tests/unit/runtime_kg tests/integration/test_audit_immutability.py
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Persistence tests and integrity verification pass.
- [ ] All declared dependencies are closed or formally waived.
- [ ] No critical privacy, fairness, educational-safety or traceability finding remains unresolved.
- [ ] The LEV verifier returns valid=true after status and evidence updates.

## Required evidence

Persistence tests and integrity verification pass.
