# LEV-03.10 — Implementation Task Card

**Workstream:** LEV-WS03 — Make learner evidence and state changes fully traceable  
**Phase:** LEV-1  
**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** `not_started`  
**Implementation type:** `governance_and_documentation`  
**Estimated effort:** S/M  
**Human dependency:** No  
**Cannot be completed by code alone:** No

## Required outcome

Define lawful retention, pseudonymisation, de-identification, deletion and research-export rules for validation events.

## Definition-of-done link

Learner evidence and state changes are fully traceable.

## Dependencies

- `LEV-03.09`

## Existing repository files to inspect or modify

- `app/models/runtime_kg.py`
- `app/services/runtime_kg/repository.py`

- `app/services/runtime_kg/integration.py`
- `app/repositories/audit_repository.py`
- `app/services/audit_service.py`

- `alembic/versions`

## Planned or new files

- `app/models/educational_validation.py`
- `app/repositories/educational_validation_repository.py`
- `app/services/educational_validation/traceability.py`
- `alembic/versions/<new>_educational_validation_traceability.py`
- `docs/research/longitudinal_validation/evidence/03.10_approved_data_management_plan_and_automated_controls.md`

## Implementation procedure

1. Read the LEV-WS03 workstream specification and confirm prerequisites for task 03.10.
2. Open or update the task evidence record before changing code, data, instruments or governance documents.
3. Implement the required work exactly as scoped: Define lawful retention, pseudonymisation, de-identification, deletion and research-export rules for validation events.
4. Circulate the draft to accountable and consulted roles.
5. Resolve comments and obtain the required versioned approval.
6. Attach or link the required evidence: Approved data-management plan and automated controls.
7. Mark complete only after the acceptance criterion is independently verifiable.

## Verification commands

```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/verify_lev_task_register.py --repo-root . --json
```
```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/lev_task_cli.py show <TASK_ID>
```
```bash
pytest -q tests/unit/runtime_kg tests/integration/test_audit_immutability.py
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Approved data-management plan and automated controls.
- [ ] All declared dependencies are closed or formally waived.
- [ ] No critical privacy, fairness, educational-safety or traceability finding remains unresolved.
- [ ] The LEV verifier returns valid=true after status and evidence updates.

## Required evidence

Approved data-management plan and automated controls.
