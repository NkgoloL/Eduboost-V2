# LEV-04.04 — Implementation Task Card

**Workstream:** LEV-WS04 — Calibrate mastery estimates against independent outcomes  
**Phase:** LEV-2  
**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** `not_started`  
**Implementation type:** `human_governance_or_research`  
**Estimated effort:** L/XL; elapsed time may be term- or cohort-bound  
**Human dependency:** Yes  
**Cannot be completed by code alone:** Yes

## Required outcome

Collect shadow-mode predictions before independent outcomes are observed.

## Definition-of-done link

Mastery estimates are calibrated against independent outcomes.

## Dependencies

- `LEV-04.03`

## Existing repository files to inspect or modify

- `app/modules/diagnostics/irt_engine.py`
- `app/modules/diagnostics/calibration_service.py`
- `app/repositories/irt_repository.py`
- `app/services/diagnostic_scoring_snapshot.py`
- `docs/research/mastery_model/rr013_evaluation_protocol.md`

## Planned or new files

- `app/services/educational_validation/calibration.py`
- `scripts/educational_validation/run_calibration_analysis.py`
- `docs/research/longitudinal_validation/evidence/04.04_timestamped_prediction_snapshots_with_no_retrospective_replacement.md`

## Implementation procedure

1. Read the LEV-WS04 workstream specification and confirm prerequisites for task 04.04.
2. Open or update the task evidence record before changing code, data, instruments or governance documents.
3. Implement the required work exactly as scoped: Collect shadow-mode predictions before independent outcomes are observed.
4. Confirm lawful authority, consent/assent, independence and conflict-of-interest controls before participant or reviewer activity.
5. Record attendance, decisions, dissent, requested corrections and signed approval or rejection.
6. Attach or link the required evidence: Timestamped prediction snapshots with no retrospective replacement.
7. Mark complete only after the acceptance criterion is independently verifiable.

## Verification commands

```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/verify_lev_task_register.py --repo-root . --json
```
```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/lev_task_cli.py show <TASK_ID>
```
```bash
pytest -q tests/legacy/unit/test_irt_engine.py tests/unit/test_irt_properties.py
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Timestamped prediction snapshots with no retrospective replacement.
- [ ] All declared dependencies are closed or formally waived.
- [ ] No critical privacy, fairness, educational-safety or traceability finding remains unresolved.
- [ ] The LEV verifier returns valid=true after status and evidence updates.

## Required evidence

Timestamped prediction snapshots with no retrospective replacement.
