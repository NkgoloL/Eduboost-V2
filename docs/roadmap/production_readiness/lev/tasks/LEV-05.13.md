# LEV-05.13 — Implementation Task Card

**Workstream:** LEV-WS05 — Quantify false-mastery and false-non-mastery risk  
**Phase:** LEV-3  
**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** `not_started`  
**Implementation type:** `human_governance_or_research`  
**Estimated effort:** L/XL; elapsed time may be term- or cohort-bound  
**Human dependency:** Yes  
**Cannot be completed by code alone:** Yes

## Required outcome

Select and approve operational thresholds for each authorised use rather than one universal threshold.

## Definition-of-done link

False-mastery and false-non-mastery rates are understood.

## Dependencies

- `LEV-05.12`

## Existing repository files to inspect or modify

- `app/modules/progress/mastery_model.py`
- `app/modules/diagnostics/irt_engine.py`
- `app/services/runtime_kg/schemas.py`
- `docs/diagnostics/mastery_model_assessment_contract.md`

## Planned or new files

- `app/services/educational_validation/classification.py`
- `scripts/educational_validation/run_classification_analysis.py`
- `docs/research/longitudinal_validation/evidence/05.13_use_specific_threshold_register.md`

## Implementation procedure

1. Read the LEV-WS05 workstream specification and confirm prerequisites for task 05.13.
2. Open or update the task evidence record before changing code, data, instruments or governance documents.
3. Implement the required work exactly as scoped: Select and approve operational thresholds for each authorised use rather than one universal threshold.
4. Confirm lawful authority, consent/assent, independence and conflict-of-interest controls before participant or reviewer activity.
5. Record attendance, decisions, dissent, requested corrections and signed approval or rejection.
6. Attach or link the required evidence: Use-specific threshold register.
7. Mark complete only after the acceptance criterion is independently verifiable.

## Verification commands

```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/verify_lev_task_register.py --repo-root . --json
```
```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/lev_task_cli.py show <TASK_ID>
```
```bash
pytest -q tests/unit/modules/progress/test_mastery_model.py
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Use-specific threshold register.
- [ ] All declared dependencies are closed or formally waived.
- [ ] No critical privacy, fairness, educational-safety or traceability finding remains unresolved.
- [ ] The LEV verifier returns valid=true after status and evidence updates.

## Required evidence

Use-specific threshold register.
