# LEV-08.03 — Implementation Task Card

**Workstream:** LEV-WS08 — Validate educational plausibility of state transitions  
**Phase:** LEV-1  
**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** `not_started`  
**Implementation type:** `engineering`  
**Estimated effort:** M/L  
**Human dependency:** No  
**Cannot be completed by code alone:** No

## Required outcome

Implement automated tests for unrelated-concept leakage, impossible jumps and unsupported certainty.

## Definition-of-done link

State transitions are educationally plausible.

## Dependencies

- `LEV-08.02`

## Existing repository files to inspect or modify

- `app/modules/progress/mastery_model.py`
- `app/services/runtime_kg/integration.py`
- `app/services/runtime_kg/service.py`
- `app/services/runtime_kg/route_integration.py`
- `tests/unit/runtime_kg`

## Planned or new files

- `app/services/educational_validation/state_reasonableness.py`
- `tests/unit/educational_validation/test_state_reasonableness.py`
- `docs/research/longitudinal_validation/evidence/08.03_transition_invariant_test_suite.md`

## Implementation procedure

1. Read the LEV-WS08 workstream specification and confirm prerequisites for task 08.03.
2. Open or update the task evidence record before changing code, data, instruments or governance documents.
3. Implement the required work exactly as scoped: Implement automated tests for unrelated-concept leakage, impossible jumps and unsupported certainty.
4. Add or update unit, integration and contract tests for the changed behaviour.
5. Run focused checks, then the LEV register verifier and applicable repository quality gates.
6. Attach or link the required evidence: Transition invariant test suite.
7. Mark complete only after the acceptance criterion is independently verifiable.

## Verification commands

```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/verify_lev_task_register.py --repo-root . --json
```
```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/lev_task_cli.py show <TASK_ID>
```
```bash
pytest -q tests/unit/runtime_kg tests/unit/modules/progress/test_mastery_model.py
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Transition invariant test suite.
- [ ] All declared dependencies are closed or formally waived.
- [ ] No critical privacy, fairness, educational-safety or traceability finding remains unresolved.
- [ ] The LEV verifier returns valid=true after status and evidence updates.

## Required evidence

Transition invariant test suite.
