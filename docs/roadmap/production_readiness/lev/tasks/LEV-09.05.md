# LEV-09.05 — Implementation Task Card

**Workstream:** LEV-WS09 — Establish validity across relevant learner contexts  
**Phase:** LEV-1  
**Priority:** P0  
**Status:** `not_started`  
**Implementation type:** `engineering`  
**Estimated effort:** M/L  
**Human dependency:** No  
**Cannot be completed by code alone:** No

## Required outcome

Implement accessibility and accommodation metadata without conflating support with ability.

## Definition-of-done link

Results remain valid across relevant learner contexts.

## Dependencies

- `LEV-09.04`

## Existing repository files to inspect or modify

- `docs/diagnostics/assessment_quality_fairness_contract.md`
- `app/modules/diagnostics/bias_review_router.py`
- `app/modules/diagnostics/quality_scorer.py`
- `app/services/runtime_kg/feature_flags.py`
- `docs/compliance`

## Planned or new files

- `app/services/educational_validation/fairness.py`
- `scripts/educational_validation/run_fairness_analysis.py`
- `docs/research/longitudinal_validation/evidence/09.05_accessible_assessment_protocol.md`

## Implementation procedure

1. Read the LEV-WS09 workstream specification and confirm prerequisites for task 09.05.
2. Open or update the task evidence record before changing code, data, instruments or governance documents.
3. Implement the required work exactly as scoped: Implement accessibility and accommodation metadata without conflating support with ability.
4. Add or update unit, integration and contract tests for the changed behaviour.
5. Run focused checks, then the LEV register verifier and applicable repository quality gates.
6. Attach or link the required evidence: Accessible assessment protocol.
7. Mark complete only after the acceptance criterion is independently verifiable.

## Verification commands

```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/verify_lev_task_register.py --repo-root . --json
```
```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/lev_task_cli.py show <TASK_ID>
```
```bash
pytest -q tests/unit/test_diagnostics_assessment_production_readiness.py
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Accessible assessment protocol.
- [ ] All declared dependencies are closed or formally waived.
- [ ] No critical privacy, fairness, educational-safety or traceability finding remains unresolved.
- [ ] The LEV verifier returns valid=true after status and evidence updates.

## Required evidence

Accessible assessment protocol.
