# LEV-12.13 — Implementation Task Card

**Workstream:** LEV-WS12 — Replicate findings in another cohort or academic year  
**Phase:** LEV-5  
**Priority:** P2  
**Status:** `not_started`  
**Implementation type:** `human_governance_or_research`  
**Estimated effort:** L/XL; elapsed time may be term- or cohort-bound  
**Human dependency:** Yes  
**Cannot be completed by code alone:** Yes

## Required outcome

Obtain independent review of replication strength and residual uncertainty.

## Definition-of-done link

Findings replicate in another cohort or academic year.

## Dependencies

- `LEV-12.12`

## Existing repository files to inspect or modify

- `docs/research/mastery_model`
- `scripts/mastery_research`
- `docs/release-evidence/roadmap-reconciliation/rr-013-advanced-mastery-model-research`

## Planned or new files

- `docs/research/longitudinal_validation/replication_protocol.md`
- `scripts/educational_validation/run_replication_analysis.py`
- `docs/research/longitudinal_validation/evidence/12.13_independent_replication_decision.md`

## Implementation procedure

1. Read the LEV-WS12 workstream specification and confirm prerequisites for task 12.13.
2. Open or update the task evidence record before changing code, data, instruments or governance documents.
3. Implement the required work exactly as scoped: Obtain independent review of replication strength and residual uncertainty.
4. Confirm lawful authority, consent/assent, independence and conflict-of-interest controls before participant or reviewer activity.
5. Record attendance, decisions, dissent, requested corrections and signed approval or rejection.
6. Attach or link the required evidence: Independent replication decision.
7. Mark complete only after the acceptance criterion is independently verifiable.

## Verification commands

```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/verify_lev_task_register.py --repo-root . --json
```
```bash
python scripts/educational_validation/lev_task_cli.py show <TASK_ID>
```
```bash

```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Independent replication decision.
- [ ] All declared dependencies are closed or formally waived.
- [ ] No critical privacy, fairness, educational-safety or traceability finding remains unresolved.
- [ ] The LEV verifier returns valid=true after status and evidence updates.

## Required evidence

Independent replication decision.
