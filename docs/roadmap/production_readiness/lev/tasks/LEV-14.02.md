## Implementation procedure

1. Read the LEV-WS14 workstream specification and confirm prerequisites for task 14.02.
2. Open or update the task evidence record before changing code, data, instruments or governance documents.
3. Implement the required work exactly as scoped: Recruit reviewers covering psychometrics, mathematics education, classroom practice, ethics/privacy, fairness and educational technology.
4. Confirm lawful authority, consent/assent, independence and conflict-of-interest controls before participant or reviewer activity.
5. Record attendance, decisions, dissent, requested corrections and signed approval or rejection.
6. Attach or link the required evidence: Panel appointments and declarations.
7. Mark complete only after the acceptance criterion is independently verifiable.
